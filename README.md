# Home Sales With Spark and Parquet
A Simple Project to use SparkSQL and Parquet to determine key metrics about home sales data

## Dataset
33287 rows of housing data were collected from an S3 Bucket, located here: https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.2/22-big-data/home_sales_revised.csv

The data included information for the following features:
* id
* date
* date_built
* price
* bedrooms
* bathrooms
* sqft_living
* sqft_lot
* floors
* waterfront
* view

## Tech Stack
This project uses:
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb files)
* Pandas
* SparkSQL
* Parquet

## Objective
This project was an attempt to see if data could be:
* imported from S3
* queried using sparqSql
* partitioned with parquet
* cached
* uncached after analysis
